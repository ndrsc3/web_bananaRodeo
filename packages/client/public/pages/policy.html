                        <p>Our community expands via a sponsorship model, where current members in good standing can invite friends to our event. <strong>When you invite someone, you are endorsing them and taking on the responsibility of integrating them</strong> into both the event and our community.</p>
                        <p>After your friend attends one of our events, they gain the ability to invite others. Therefore, select your guests carefully; you're not just inviting a friend, but also potentially opening the door to their network of friends.</p>

                        <h2>Can I invite people?</h2>
                        <p>If you received an email invitation directly from Banana Rodeo, you are welcome to invite friends. Please use your discretion and good judgmentâ€”invite only those who you believe will blend well with our existing community.</p>
                        <p>However, if a friend invited you and not Banana Rodeo directly, you cannot invite your friends just yet. We will add you to the invitation list once you've attended one of our events, but we ask that you experience our community before contributing to its growth.</p>

If your first-time guest RSVP'd for an upcoming private event using their own email address, they will receive our logistical messages for that event. After they have successfully attended their first event, they will be added to our main mailing list.</p>
                        <p>Please encourage your invited friends to frequent our website for all information about this private event.</p>

                        <h2>Be prepared for day-of</h2>
                        <p>Please ensure your invited friends are prepared for the experience they are about to have. Make sure they bring everything they need and brief them on the ground rules:</p>

                        <p>When posting and interacting on social media, please refer to our Sponsorship Model and Code of Conduct. Keep in mind that there will most likely be folks who are not sponsees viewing your content â€“ and they may not be folks you want to be responsible for!</p>
                        <p>We ask that if you do post on social media, please lean on nicknames and discretion at all times and target your content towards private audiences.</p>

                        <p>Exercise discretion when using cameras at our private event. Respect that not everyone wishes to be photographed or filmed, receiving consent can be difficult, and the presence of cameras without consent can alter the atmosphere for those around.</p>
                        <p>Polaroid cameras and reusable film cameras offer a good substitute for cell phones. If you choose to capture media at The Banana Rodeo, please adhere to these guidelines:</p>
